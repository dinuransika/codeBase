  Approach: Any number can be represented as the sum of perfect squares. Since a number N can always be expressed as the sum of squares of 1, the maximum count of perfect squares
            that sums to N is N for any number N. But that can be minimized for numbers larger than 3. Let count(x) = minimum number of perfect squares that sums to x.
            Thus, count(x) = x if x <= 3; min(x, 1 + count(x - i * i) for i in range(1, ceiling(sqrt(x))) Otherwise) where i * i is a perfect square less than x.
            Therefore, a dynamic programming approach can be used to efficiently calculate the count.
